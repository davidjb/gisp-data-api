ask-me-anything session with [David Beitey (@davidjb)](https://git.io/davidjb).

Delivered as part of an industry/educator partnership formed in the
[ICT Gateway to Industry Schools Program (GISP) initiative](https://qldictgisp.acs.org.au/).

## Outline

* Intro — outline, ask questions, introduction
* Background — who I am, my experience
* APIs:

  * Demo and walkthrough of [examples](#examples)
  * General outline: what they are, how they work

    * [REST (`Representational State Transfer`)](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer) — software _style_ involving textual representation of
      _resources_ that allow reading/modification using a defined set of
      operations. In short, it's about using HTTP methods (GET/POST/PUT/DELETE
      etc) to access/change data on a remote server in a set way.

  * Data formats + view examples:

    * `JSON` (most common/universal): [example](https://www.data.qld.gov.au/api/3/action/datastore_search?resource_id=8dbceb06-aa8f-411a-baae-13d66475fdd7&limit=5)
    * `XML`:
      [example](https://qldspatial.information.qld.gov.au/catalogueadmin/rest/document?id={40D75ED6-3959-41EB-A5C8-E563FA5B66CA})

  * Tools & documentation vary wildly between APIs

    * [Wikipedia API sandbox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:ApiSandbox#action=query&format=json&origin=*&prop=pageimages%7Cinfo%7Cdescription%7Cpageprops%7Cpageterms%7Cmapdata&titles=Phascolarctos%20cinereus&redirects=1&formatversion=2&piprop=original&inprop=url%7Cdisplaytitle)
    * [Koala WildNet data](https://www.data.qld.gov.au/dataset/wildnet-koala-locations/resource/8dbceb06-aa8f-411a-baae-13d66475fdd7)
    * ...or little/no documentation at all

* Work Experience:

  * [JCU Research Portfolio](https://jcu.me) — [redesigned UI](https://research.jcu.io) [Python, web design, SQL, databases]
  * IoT — [Classroom on the Reef](https://www.jcu.edu.au/classroom-on-the-reef/livecams) and [live sensor data](https://cotr-data.jcu.edu.au)
  * Home Assistant for automation
  * Security: software analysis, vulnerability reporting to companies, reviewing their APIs

* Q&A Session: ask me anything; around the syllabus or anything else

* Shameless plugs:

  * [DevNQ](https://devnq.org) - community run, all-invlusive group for IT developers (events, hackathon on Townsville Show weekend in July, socials)
  * [Young ICT Explorers](https://www.youngictexplorers.net.au/) - yearly competition that students/schools can enter and win prizes
  * [TCC Big Ideas Youth Challenge](https://www.eventbrite.com.au/e/townsville-city-council-big-ideas-youth-challenge-tickets-142196669065) - 22 April 2021, one day event around innovation, entrepreneurship and change. Also a PD session held on the day prior for teachers.
